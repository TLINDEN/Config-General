 2.14    - fixed bug reported by Francisco Olarte Sanz
	   <folarte@peoplecall.com>, which caused _parse to
	   ignore blocks with the name "0": 
	   <0> .. </0>, because it checked just if $block (the name
	   between < and >) is true, and from the perl point
	   of view "0" is not. Changed it to check for defined.
	   Normally I avoid using 'defined' but in this case
	   it will not be possible that $block contains the
	   empty string, so defined is ok here.

 2.13    - fixed bug reported by Steffen Schwigon <schwigon@webit.de>.
	   the parser was still active inside a here-doc, which
	   cause weird results if the here-doc contained
	   multiple <<XXX strings.
	   this bug has been fixed by re-organizing the _read()
	   method. now the parser is only active outside of
	   here-docs.

	 - here-doc parsing bug fixed, which ignored the
	   -SplitPolicy settings completely, now it is aware
	   of the split policy

 2.12    - fixed cpan bugid #1768, stuff inside a hash given
	   by the -DefaultConfig parameter was ignored by
	   the new interpolation code, this has been fixed.

	 - fixed another bug in the new interpolation code,
	   which made variable global, the variable scope
	   were ignored. Now a special constructed hash
	   exists, which makes sure, that variables only
	   valid within its correct scope.

 2.11	 - heavy change in the variable interpolation code.
	   Peter Sergeant <pete@clueball.com> reported this
	   mis-behavior. The problem was that the whole hash
	   was feeded to ::Interpolated.pm, but as we all
	   know, perl hashes doesn't preserve the order. So,
	   in our case the module sometimes was unable to
	   resolve variablenames, because they were stored
	   in a different location as it occured in the config.
	   The change is, that Config::General now calls
	   ::Interpolate.pm (new sub: _interpolate()) itself
	   directly on a per-key/value pair basis. The internal
	   varstack is now stored on $this globally. So, now
	   a variable will be known when it occurs. period :-)


 2.10    - added -StrictVars documentation section to the POD,
	   which was missing.

         - fixed a formatting error in the POD documentation.


 2.09    - added bugfix in '#' comment parsing. If current state
	   was within a block, then /^   #/ was not ignored as
	   comment but instead added as variable. Reported by
	   Lupe Christoph <lupe@lupe-christoph.de>

	 - added -StrictObjects parameter support in the following
	   ::Extended methods: hash() and value().

	 - added better parameter checks in the ::Extended::obj()
	   method. Its now no more possible to create a new (sub-)
	   object from an undefined key or a key which does not
	   point to a hash reference.

	 - simplified storing of ConfigFile and ConfigHash in new()
	   removed my variable $configfile.

	 - the original parameter list will now be saved, which is
	   required for ::Extended to create new objects with the
	   same config as their parents.

 2.08    - added option -StrictVars, which causes Interpolate.pm to
	   ignore undefined variables and replaces such occurences
	   with the emppty string.

	 - applied patch by Stefan Moser <sm@open.ch>, which fixes
	   some weird bevavior if -MergeDuplicateOptions was turned
	   on, the parser croaked regardless -MergeDuplicateBlocks
	   was set or not. Now the two options behave almost independent
	   from each other, which allows one to merge duplicate
	   blocks but duplicate options not.

	 - changed behavior of setting -MergeDuplicateOptions which
	   implied in previous versions -AllowMultiOptions to be
	   false. Now this will only be done if the user does not
	   set -AllowMultiOptions by himself. This allows one to
	   have duplicate blocks which will be turned into an
	   array but duplicate options to be merged.

	 - applied patch by Matthias Pitzl <matthias@izb.net>, which	
	   fixes a bug at parsing apache-like include directive
	   (Include ...). It did not properly trim unnecessary whitespaces
	   so that the filename to be included became invalid. This
	   bug espessially occurred if one saved a hash containing
	   a key/value pair like this: "Include" => "/etc/grs.cfg",
	   which was then saved as "Include   /etc/grs.cfg", the
	   parser returned "  /etc/grs.cfg" which, of course, does
	   not exists. odd...

 2.07    - fixed cpan bugid #1351, SaveConfig contained a deprecated
           function call which caused the module to croak.
         - added feature request, if in extended mode (OOP turned
           on with -ExtendedAccess => 1 access to non-existent keys	
           caused a croak. While this is still the default behavior
           it is now possible to turn this off using -StrictObjects => 0.
         - added this to the related pod section in ::Extended.
         - fixed bug in new() which caused a couple of errors
           if the ConfigFile parameter is not set, or is set to
           undef. In this case it will now simply create an empty
           object.
         - fixed related bug in save_file() which will save "" to
           a file now if the config is uninitialized (i.e. the case
           mentioned below arrived).

 2.06    - added -SplitPolicy, -SplitDelimiter and -StoreDelimiter
	 - removed whitespace support in keys in the default parser
	   SplitPolicy 'guess', which was introduced in 2.02. Now
	   I (re-)use the old regex I used before. if you need
	   whitespaces in keys, use 'equalsign' as SplitPolicy.
	 - the write_scalar() method uses the StoreDelimiter for
	   separating options from values.
	 - added -CComments to make it possible to turn c-comment
	   parsing off.
	 - added support for FileHandle objects as parameter to the
	   -ConfigFile parameter. This makes it possible to use locking.

 2.05    - fixed bug in ::Extended. It exported for some weird
           reason I cant remember all of its methods. This included
	   keys() exists() and delete(), which are perl internals.
	   If one used keys() on a normal hash, then the ::Extended
	   own keys() were used instead of perls own one. I removed
	   the export line.

 2.04    - added RFE from rt.cpan.org (ID: 1218). the ::Interpolate
	   module populates now uses of uninitialized variables in
	   config files itself instead of just letting perl die().
	   The other suggestion of the RFE was declined.

 2.03    - fixed bug in the _parse() routine (better: design flaw).
           after the last patch for allowing whitespaces in
	   option names, it had a problem with here-docs which
	   contained equal signs. option/value splitting resulted
	   in weird output.

	 - as a side effect of the bug fix below it is now
	   possible to use equal signs inside quoted values, which
	   will then be ignored, thus not used for splitting
	   the line into an option/value assignment.

	 - added a new test, which tests for all possible notations
	   of option/value lines.

 2.02    - added patch by Jens Heunemann, which allows to use
           whitespaces in option names.

         - changed the save() calls in the test script (t/run.t)
           to save_file()

	 - removed new() from ::Interpolated and ::Extended.
	   This may break existing code (they will need to
	   move to the flags of Config::General::new() ), but
	   this decision must be made. The problem was that
	   both the old way of directly using the subclasses
	   and the enw way did not work together. So, now
	   subclasses are only method holders and used by
	   Config::General on request. Direct use of subclasses
	   is prohibited. (you receive a warning if you do).


 2.01    - added -ConfigFile (in replace for -file) and
           -ConfigHash (in replace for -hash) to get a consistent
	   parameter naming scheme. The old names are still
	   supported for backward compatibility, but no more
	   documented.

         - the parameter -BaseHash has been dropped because
	   -DefaultConfig already has the capabilities of
           defining a custom backing hash. The pod section for
	   -DefaultConfig has been enhanced to reflect this.

	 - README changed something. Removed the 'small' keyword,
	   because the module isn't really small anymore :-)
	   At least IMHO.

 2.00    - fixed a bug in the ::Extended::keys() method, which 
	   caused a beloved "use of uninitialized ..." message.
	   Reported by Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>.

         - Removed all deprecated methods (in fact, they are still
	   there for shouting out a warn that its deprecated. But
	   the pod sections are removed. These are NoMultiOptions()
	   and save().

	 - added two new parameters to new(): -InterPolateVars and
	   -ExtendedAccess, which allows one to use the functionalites
	   of the supplied submodules without the need to decide
	   for one of them. This makes it possible to use variable
	   interpolation and oop access in the same time. Suggested
	   by Jared Rhine <jared@wordzoo.com>.

	 - added new parameter -BaseHash which makes it possible
	   to supply your own hash which stores the parsed contents
	   of the config. This can be a tied hash o the like.
	   Suggested by Jared Rhine <jared@wordzoo.com> too.

	 - switched to release 2.00 because the above is a major
	   change.

 1.36    - simplified new() parameter parsing, should be now a little
	   bit better to understand.

	 - added new parameter -DefaultConfig, which can hold a hashref
	   or a string, which will be used to pre-define values
	   of the resulting hash after parsing a config.
	   Thanks to Mark Hampton <mark.hampton@qualis.com> for the
	   suggestion.

	 - added new parameter -MergeDuplicateOptions, which allows
	   one to overwrite duplicate options, which is required,
	   if you turn on -DefaultConfig, because otherwise a
 	   array would be created, which is probably not what you
	   wanted.

	 - added patch by Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>
	   to Config::General::Extended::keys(), which allows to
	   retrieve the keys of the object itself (which was not
	   directly possible before)

	 - added patch by Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>
	   to Config::General::Extended::value(), which allows to
	   set a value to a (perlish-) nontrue value. This was a
	   bug.

	 - added patch by Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>
	   to Config::General::_parse_value, which fixes a bug in
	   this method, which in prior versions caused values of
	   "0" (zero digit) to be wiped out of the config.

	 - added tests in t/run.t for the new default config feature.
	 
	

 1.35    - the here-doc identifier in saved configs will now created
           in a way which avoids the existence of this identifier
	   inside the here-doc, which if it happens results in
           weird behavior in the resulting config.

 1.34    - Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au> reported a bug
           in _store(), which caused the module to create scalar
	   entries even if the entry contained newlines. While
	   Danial supplied a patch to fix this - thx(TM) - I
	   did not apply it, because I "outsourced" this kind of
	   stuff to the subroutine _write_scalar(), see next.

         - added internal methods _write_scalar() and _write_hash()
	   to simplify _store(), which did the same thing more
	   than once, which is a good time to create a sub which
	   does the job.

         - fixed cut'n paste bug in General/Extended.pm reported by
	   Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>, which caused
	   Config::General::Extended::is_scalar() to return true even
	   when the key you pass in is an array.

         - added new method Config::General::Extended::delete() suggested
	   by Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>, which deletes
	   the given key from the config.

 1.33    - fixed bug in _parse_value() which caused perl to complain
	   with "Use of uninitialized value in..." if a value was
	   empty.


 1.32    - *argl* ... I forgot Interpolated.pm, don't know how that
           could happen, in 1.29 it was "lost". However - 
	   I added it again now.
	 - added patch by Peder Stray <peder@linpro.no> to
	   the _store() method, which makes it possible to catch
	   arrays of hashes to be stored correctly.
	 - cleaned up the t/run.t testscript to reflect the
	   changes (in fact I did not touch it since 1.18 or so).
	 - added test number 16 to test variable interpolation
	   using ::Interpolated in t/run.t.
	 - fixed bug with new() parameter -AllowMultiOptions which
	   generated a croak() if set to something other than "no".
	 - changed Extended::save() to reflect the API change,
	   it calls now save_file(). 

 1.31:   - i'm such a moron ... I forgot to do a make clean
           in 1.30, pf. So this is 1.31, which is clean.

 1.30:   - fixed typo, which made 1.29 unusable (undefined var %config)
         - added code to check if unknown parameters to new()
	   has been supplied.

 1.29:
	 - added 2 procedural functions ParseConf and SaveConf
	 - added new parameters -AutoTrue and -FlagBits
	 - added save_file() which replaces save(), which was
	   weird implemented. If the user only supplied a hash
           as parameter to save(), then the first key was
	   used as the filename and the rest was used
	   as a config hash (which was then of an uneven size).
	 - save_file() takes now instead of a hash a hash-ref
	   and a filename. And the hashref is optional, since
	   the object already contains a complete hash.
	 - new method save_string() added, which returns the
	   ready generated string instead of writing it to
	   disk. The user can then save it himself.
	 - POD updated.

 1.28:
	 - added contributed sub module Config::General::Interpolated
	   by "Wei-Hon Chen" <plasmaball@pchome.com.tw> with
	   help from "Autrijus Tang" <autrijus@autrijus.org>
	   which makes it possible to use variables inside
	   config files.
	 - _read() accepts now c-comments inside c-comments if
	   they are on a single line.
	 - _read() is now more tolerant to here-identifiers
	   (the ends of here-docs), whitespaces right after
	   such an identifier are allowed (i.e. "EOF  ").
	 - _read() does now behave somewhat different with
	   C-comments, they will be the first thing being
	   processed in a config, so the parser really
	   ignores everything inside C-comments. Previously
	   it did not do that, for example here-docs has
	   not been ignored.

 1.27:   - "make test" complained about uninitialized value
           in :146, which is now fixed.

 1.26:   - added filehandle capability to -file.
         - added -String parameter to new(), which allows
           one to supply the whole config as a string.
         - added -MergeDuplicateBlocks option, which causes
	   duplicate blocks to be merged.

 1.25:   - include statements are now case insensitive
 	 - include statements may now also being used with
	   indentation(leading and following whitespaces are
	   allowed)
	 - changed the end here-doc regexp from .+? to \S+?
	   so "  <<include..." works as expected (this was a bug, imo)
	 - added new option -IncludeRelative (idea contributed
	   by Valerio_Valdez Paolini <paolini@students.cs.unibo.it>
	   and Anton Luht <luht@ank.ru> :-)
	   This allows to include files from the location of
	   the configfile instead from the working directory.

 1.24:   - AllowMultiOptions printed out the value and not the
           option itself, if more than one of this particular
           option occured.
         - added -UseApacheInclude feature, contributed by
           Thomas Klausner <domm@zsi.at>
         - fixed bug with multiple options stuff, which did not
           work with blocks or named blocks. Pointed out by
           Thomas Klausner <domm@zsi.at>, who meant it being
           feature request, but in fact it was a bug (IMHO).
	 - Config::General does now contain also it's OO-sister
	   Config::General::Extended, which is from now on
 	   no more available as an extra module, because it
	   lived a shadowy existence.
	 - finally(!) created a Changelog file (this one, yes).

 1.23:   - fixed bug, which removed trailing or leading " even
           no matching " was there.

 1.22:   - added a new option to new(): -LowerCaseNames, which
           lowercases all option-names (feature request)

 1.21:   - lines with just one "#" became an option array named
           "#" with empty entries, very weird, fixed

 1.20:   - added an if(exists... to new() for checking of the
           existence of -AllowMultiOptions.
         - use now "local $_" because it caused weird results
           if a user used $_ with the module.

 1.19:   - you can escape "#" characters using a backslash: "\#"
           which will now no more treated as a comment.
         - comments inside here-documents will now remain in the
           here-doc value.

history logs 1.17+1.18 are lost in space :-(
