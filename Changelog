 2.05    - fixed bug in ::Extended. It exported for some weird
           reason I cant remember all of its methods. This included
	   keys() exists() and delete(), which are perl internals.
	   If one used keys() on a normal hash, then the ::Extended
	   own keys() were used instead of perls own one. I removed
	   the export line.

 2.04    - added RFE from rt.cpan.org (ID: 1218). the ::Interpolate
	   module populates now uses of uninitialized variables in
	   config files itself instead of just letting perl die().
	   The other suggestion of the RFE was declined.

 2.03    - fixed bug in the _parse() routine (better: design flaw).
           after the last patch for allowing whitespaces in
	   option names, it had a problem with here-docs which
	   contained equal signs. option/value splitting resulted
	   in weird output.

	 - as a side effect of the bug fix below it is now
	   possible to use equal signs inside quoted values, which
	   will then be ignored, thus not used for splitting
	   the line into an option/value assignment.

	 - added a new test, which tests for all possible notations
	   of option/value lines.

 2.02    - added patch by Jens Heunemann, which allows to use
           whitespaces in option names.

         - changed the save() calls in the test script (t/run.t)
           to save_file()

	 - removed new() from ::Interpolated and ::Extended.
	   This may break existing code (they will need to
	   move to the flags of Config::General::new() ), but
	   this decision must be made. The problem was that
	   both the old way of directly using the subclasses
	   and the enw way did not work together. So, now
	   subclasses are only method holders and used by
	   Config::General on request. Direct use of subclasses
	   is prohibited. (you receive a warning if you do).


 2.01    - added -ConfigFile (in replace for -file) and
           -ConfigHash (in replace for -hash) to get a consistent
	   parameter naming scheme. The old names are still
	   supported for backward compatibility, but no more
	   documented.

         - the parameter -BaseHash has been dropped because
	   -DefaultConfig already has the capabilities of
           defining a custom backing hash. The pod section for
	   -DefaultConfig has been enhanced to reflect this.

	 - README changed something. Removed the 'small' keyword,
	   because the module isn't really small anymore :-)
	   At least IMHO.

 2.00    - fixed a bug in the ::Extended::keys() method, which 
	   caused a beloved "use of uninitialized ..." message.
	   Reported by Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>.

         - Removed all deprecated methods (in fact, they are still
	   there for shouting out a warn that its deprecated. But
	   the pod sections are removed. These are NoMultiOptions()
	   and save().

	 - added two new parameters to new(): -InterPolateVars and
	   -ExtendedAccess, which allows one to use the functionalites
	   of the supplied submodules without the need to decide
	   for one of them. This makes it possible to use variable
	   interpolation and oop access in the same time. Suggested
	   by Jared Rhine <jared@wordzoo.com>.

	 - added new parameter -BaseHash which makes it possible
	   to supply your own hash which stores the parsed contents
	   of the config. This can be a tied hash o the like.
	   Suggested by Jared Rhine <jared@wordzoo.com> too.

	 - switched to release 2.00 because the above is a major
	   change.

 1.36    - simplified new() parameter parsing, should be now a little
	   bit better to understand.

	 - added new parameter -DefaultConfig, which can hold a hashref
	   or a string, which will be used to pre-define values
	   of the resulting hash after parsing a config.
	   Thanks to Mark Hampton <mark.hampton@qualis.com> for the
	   suggestion.

	 - added new parameter -MergeDuplicateOptions, which allows
	   one to overwrite duplicate options, which is required,
	   if you turn on -DefaultConfig, because otherwise a
 	   array would be created, which is probably not what you
	   wanted.

	 - added patch by Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>
	   to Config::General::Extended::keys(), which allows to
	   retrieve the keys of the object itself (which was not
	   directly possible before)

	 - added patch by Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>
	   to Config::General::Extended::value(), which allows to
	   set a value to a (perlish-) nontrue value. This was a
	   bug.

	 - added patch by Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>
	   to Config::General::_parse_value, which fixes a bug in
	   this method, which in prior versions caused values of
	   "0" (zero digit) to be wiped out of the config.

	 - added tests in t/run.t for the new default config feature.
	 
	

 1.35    - the here-doc identifier in saved configs will now created
           in a way which avoids the existence of this identifier
	   inside the here-doc, which if it happens results in
           weird behavior in the resulting config.

 1.34    - Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au> reported a bug
           in _store(), which caused the module to create scalar
	   entries even if the entry contained newlines. While
	   Danial supplied a patch to fix this - thx(TM) - I
	   did not apply it, because I "outsourced" this kind of
	   stuff to the subroutine _write_scalar(), see next.

         - added internal methods _write_scalar() and _write_hash()
	   to simplify _store(), which did the same thing more
	   than once, which is a good time to create a sub which
	   does the job.

         - fixed cut'n paste bug in General/Extended.pm reported by
	   Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>, which caused
	   Config::General::Extended::is_scalar() to return true even
	   when the key you pass in is an array.

         - added new method Config::General::Extended::delete() suggested
	   by Danial Pearce <danial@infoxchange.net.au>, which deletes
	   the given key from the config.

 1.33    - fixed bug in _parse_value() which caused perl to complain
	   with "Use of uninitialized value in..." if a value was
	   empty.


 1.32    - *argl* ... I forgot Interpolated.pm, don't know how that
           could happen, in 1.29 it was "lost". However - 
	   I added it again now.
	 - added patch by Peder Stray <peder@linpro.no> to
	   the _store() method, which makes it possible to catch
	   arrays of hashes to be stored correctly.
	 - cleaned up the t/run.t testscript to reflect the
	   changes (in fact I did not touch it since 1.18 or so).
	 - added test number 16 to test variable interpolation
	   using ::Interpolated in t/run.t.
	 - fixed bug with new() parameter -AllowMultiOptions which
	   generated a croak() if set to something other than "no".
	 - changed Extended::save() to reflect the API change,
	   it calls now save_file(). 

 1.31:   - i'm such a moron ... I forgot to do a make clean
           in 1.30, pf. So this is 1.31, which is clean.

 1.30:   - fixed typo, which made 1.29 unusable (undefined var %config)
         - added code to check if unknown parameters to new()
	   has been supplied.

 1.29:
	 - added 2 procedural functions ParseConf and SaveConf
	 - added new parameters -AutoTrue and -FlagBits
	 - added save_file() which replaces save(), which was
	   weird implemented. If the user only supplied a hash
           as parameter to save(), then the first key was
	   used as the filename and the rest was used
	   as a config hash (which was then of an uneven size).
	 - save_file() takes now instead of a hash a hash-ref
	   and a filename. And the hashref is optional, since
	   the object already contains a complete hash.
	 - new method save_string() added, which returns the
	   ready generated string instead of writing it to
	   disk. The user can then save it himself.
	 - POD updated.

 1.28:
	 - added contributed sub module Config::General::Interpolated
	   by "Wei-Hon Chen" <plasmaball@pchome.com.tw> with
	   help from "Autrijus Tang" <autrijus@autrijus.org>
	   which makes it possible to use variables inside
	   config files.
	 - _read() accepts now c-comments inside c-comments if
	   they are on a single line.
	 - _read() is now more tolerant to here-identifiers
	   (the ends of here-docs), whitespaces right after
	   such an identifier are allowed (i.e. "EOF  ").
	 - _read() does now behave somewhat different with
	   C-comments, they will be the first thing being
	   processed in a config, so the parser really
	   ignores everything inside C-comments. Previously
	   it did not do that, for example here-docs has
	   not been ignored.

 1.27:   - "make test" complained about uninitialized value
           in :146, which is now fixed.

 1.26:   - added filehandle capability to -file.
         - added -String parameter to new(), which allows
           one to supply the whole config as a string.
         - added -MergeDuplicateBlocks option, which causes
	   duplicate blocks to be merged.

 1.25:   - include statements are now case insensitive
 	 - include statements may now also being used with
	   indentation(leading and following whitespaces are
	   allowed)
	 - changed the end here-doc regexp from .+? to \S+?
	   so "  <<include..." works as expected (this was a bug, imo)
	 - added new option -IncludeRelative (idea contributed
	   by Valerio_Valdez Paolini <paolini@students.cs.unibo.it>
	   and Anton Luht <luht@ank.ru> :-)
	   This allows to include files from the location of
	   the configfile instead from the working directory.

 1.24:   - AllowMultiOptions printed out the value and not the
           option itself, if more than one of this particular
           option occured.
         - added -UseApacheInclude feature, contributed by
           Thomas Klausner <domm@zsi.at>
         - fixed bug with multiple options stuff, which did not
           work with blocks or named blocks. Pointed out by
           Thomas Klausner <domm@zsi.at>, who meant it being
           feature request, but in fact it was a bug (IMHO).
	 - Config::General does now contain also it's OO-sister
	   Config::General::Extended, which is from now on
 	   no more available as an extra module, because it
	   lived a shadowy existence.
	 - finally(!) created a Changelog file (this one, yes).

 1.23:   - fixed bug, which removed trailing or leading " even
           no matching " was there.

 1.22:   - added a new option to new(): -LowerCaseNames, which
           lowercases all option-names (feature request)

 1.21:   - lines with just one "#" became an option array named
           "#" with empty entries, very weird, fixed

 1.20:   - added an if(exists... to new() for checking of the
           existence of -AllowMultiOptions.
         - use now "local $_" because it caused weird results
           if a user used $_ with the module.

 1.19:   - you can escape "#" characters using a backslash: "\#"
           which will now no more treated as a comment.
         - comments inside here-documents will now remain in the
           here-doc value.

history logs 1.17+1.18 are lost in space :-(
