 1.24:   - AllowMultiOptions printed out the value and not the
           option itself, if more than one of this particular
           option occured.
         - added -UseApacheInclude feature, contributed by
           Thomas Klausner <domm@zsi.at>
         - fixed bug with multiple options stuff, which did not
           work with blocks or named blocks. Pointed out by
           Thomas Klausner <domm@zsi.at>, who meant it being
           feature request, but in fact it was a bug (IMHO).
	 - Config::General does now contain also it's OO-sister
	   Config::General::Extended, which is from now on
 	   no more available as an extra module, because it
	   lived a shadowy existence.
	 - finally(!) created a Changelog file (this one, yes).

 1.23:   - fixed bug, which removed trailing or leading " even
           no matching " was there.

 1.22:   - added a new option to new(): -LowerCaseNames, which
           lowercases all option-names (feature request)

 1.21:   - lines with just one "#" became an option array named
           "#" with empty entries, very weird, fixed

 1.20:   - added an if(exists... to new() for checking of the
           existence of -AllowMultiOptions.
         - use now "local $_" because it caused weird results
           if a user used $_ with the module.

 1.19:   - you can escape "#" characters using a backslash: "\#"
           which will now no more treated as a comment.
         - comments inside here-documents will now remain in the
           here-doc value.

 previous history logs are lost in space :-(
