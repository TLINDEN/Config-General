NAME
       Config::General - Generic Config Module

SYNOPSIS
        use Config::General;
        $conf = new Config::General("rcfile");
        my %config = $conf->getall;


DESCRIPTION
       This small module opens a config file and parses it's
       contents for you. The new method requires one parameter
       which needs to be a filename. The method getall returns a
       hash which contains all options and it's associated values
       of your config file.

       The format of config files supported by Config::General is
       inspired by the well known apache config format, in fact,
       this module is 100% compatible to apache configs, but you
       can also just use simple name/value pairs in your config
       files.

       In addition to the capabilities of an apache config file
       it supports some enhancements such as here-documents, C-
       style comments or multiline options.
