NAME
       Config::General - Generic Config Module

SYNOPSIS
        use Config::General;
        $conf = new Config::General(-ConfigFile => "myconfig.rc");
        my %config = $conf->getall;


DESCRIPTION
       This module opens a config file and parses it's contents
       for you. After parsing the module returns a hash structure
       which contains the representation of the config file.

       The format of config files supported by Config::General is
       inspired by the well known apache config format, in fact,
       this module is 100% read-compatible to apache configs, but
       you can also just use simple name/value pairs in your config
       files.

       In addition to the capabilities of a apache config file
       it supports some enhancements such as here-documents, C-
       style comments or multiline options. It is also possible to
       save the config back to disk, which makes the module a
       perfect backend for configuration interfaces.

       It is possible to use variables in config files and there
       exists also support for object oriented access to the
       configuration.
