=head1 NAME

Config::General - Generic Config Module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #
 # the OOP way
 use Config::General;
 $conf = new Config::General("rcfile");
 my %config = $conf->getall;

 #
 # the procedural way
 use Config::General;
 my %config = ParseConfig("rcfile");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module opens a config file and parses it's contents for you. The B<new> method
requires one parameter which needs to be a filename. The method B<getall> returns a hash
which contains all options and it's associated values of your config file.

The format of config files supported by B<Config::General> is inspired by the well known apache config
format, in fact, this module is 100% compatible to apache configs, but you can also just use simple
name/value pairs in your config files.

In addition to the capabilities of an apache config file it supports some enhancements such as here-documents,
C-style comments or multiline options.


=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new()

Possible ways to call B<new()>:

 $conf = new Config::General("rcfile");

 $conf = new Config::General(\%somehash);

 $conf = new Config::General( %options ); # see below for description of possible options


This method returns a B<Config::General> object (a hash blessed into "Config::General" namespace.
All further methods must be used from that returned object. see below.

You can use the new style with hash parameters or the old style which is of course
still supported. Possible parameters to B<new()> are:

* a filename of a configfile, which will be opened and parsed by the parser

or

* a hash reference, which will be used as the config.

An alternative way to call B<new()> is supplying an option- hash with one or more of
the following keys set:

=over

=item B<-file>

A filename or a filehandle, i.e.:

 -file => "rcfile" or -file => \$FileHandle



=item B<-hash>

A hash reference, which will be used as the config, i.e.:

 -hash => \%somehash



=item B<-String>

A string which contains a whole config, or an arrayref
containing the whole config line by line.
The parser will parse the contents of the string instead
of a file. i.e:

 -String => $complete_config

it is also possible to feed an array reference to -String:

 -String => \@config_lines



=item B<-AllowMultiOptions>

If the value is "no", then multiple identical options are disallowed.
The default is "yes".
i.e.:

 -AllowMultiOptions => "no"

see B<IDENTICAL OPTIONS> for details.

=item B<-LowerCaseNames>

If set to a true value, then all options found in the config will be converted
to lowercase. This allows you to provide case-in-sensitive configs. The
values of the options will B<not> lowercased.



=item B<-UseApacheInclude>

If set to a true value, the parser will consider "include ..." as valid include
statement (just like the well known apache include statement).



=item B<-IncludeRelative>

If set to a true value, included files with a relative path (i.e. "cfg/blah.conf")
will be opened from within the location of the configfile instead from within the
location of the script($0). This works only if the configfile has a absolute pathname
(i.e. "/etc/main.conf").



=item B<-MergeDuplicateBlocks>

If set to a true value, then duplicate blocks, that means blocks and named blocks,
will be merged into a single one (see below for more details on this).
The default behavior of Config::General is to create an array if some junk in a
config appears more than once.


=item B<-AutoTrue>

If set to a true value, then options in your config file, whose values are set to
true or false values, will be normalised to 1 or 0 respectively.

The following values will be considered as B<true>:

 yes, on, 1, true

The following values will be considered as B<false>:

 no, off, 0, false

This effect is case-insensitive, i.e. both "Yes" or "oN" will result in 1.


=item B<-FlagBits>

This option takes one required parameter, which must be a hash reference.

The supplied hash reference needs to define variables for which you
want to preset values. Each variable you have defined in this hash-ref
and which occurs in your config file, will cause this variable being
set to the preset values to which the value in the config file refers to.

Multiple flags can be used, separated by the pipe character |.

Well, an example will clarify things:

 my $conf = new Config::General(
         -file => "rcfile",
         -FlagBits => {
              Mode => {
                 CLEAR    => 1,
                 STRONG   => 1,
                 UNSECURE => "32bit" }
         }
 );

In this example we are defining a variable named I<"Mode"> which
may contain one or more of "CLEAR", "STRONG" and "UNSECURE" as value.

The appropriate config entry may look like this:

 # rcfile
 Mode = CLEAR | UNSECURE

The parser will create a hash which will be the value of the key "Mode". This
hash will contain B<all> flags which you have pre-defined, but only those
which were set in the config will contain the pre-defined value, the other
ones will be undefined.

The resulting config structure would look like this after parsing:

 %config = (
             Mode => {
                       CLEAR    => 1,
                       UNSECURE => "32bit",
                       STRONG   => undef,
                     }
           );

This method allows the user (or, the "maintainer" of the configfile for your
application) to set multiple pre-defined values for one option.

Please beware, that all occurences of thos variables will be handled this
way, there is no way to distinguish between variables in different scopes.
That means, that if "Mode" would also occur inside a named block, it would
also parsed this way.

Values which are not defined in the hash-ref supplied to the parameter B<-FlagBits>
and used in the corresponding variable in the config will be ignored.

Example:

 # rcfile
 Mode = BLAH | CLEAR

would result in this hash structure:

  %config = (
             Mode => {
                       CLEAR    => 1,
                       UNSECURE => undef,
                       STRONG   => undef,
                     }
           );

"BLAH" will be ignored silently.

=back

=item NoMultiOptions()

This method only exists for compatibility reasons and is deprecated.
Now you should set the parameter to the B<new()> method B<-AllowMultiOptions> to "no".

see B<METHODS>.


=item getall()

Returns a hash structure which represents the whole config.


=item save()

B<Deprectated. Use save_file() instead!>


=item save_file()

Writes the config hash back to the harddisk. This method takes one or two
parameters. The first parameter must be the filename where the config
should be written to. The second parameter is optional, it must be a
reference to a hash structure, if you set it. If you do not supply this second parameter
then the internal config hash, which has already been parsed, will be
used.

Please note, that any occurence of comments will be ignored by getall()
and thus be lost after you call this method.

You need also to know that named blocks will be converted to nested blocks
(which is the same from the perl point of view). An example:

 <user hans>
   id 13
 </user>

will become the following after saving:

 <user>
   <hans>
      id 13
   </hans>
 </user>

Example:

 $conf_obj->save_file("newrcfile", \%config);

or, if the config has already been parsed, or if it didn't change:

 $conf_obj->save_file("newrcfile");


=item save_string()

This method is equivalent to the previous save_file(), but it does not
store the generated config to a file. Instead it returns it as a string,
which you can save yourself afterwards.

It takes one optional parameter, which must be a reference to a hash structure.
If you omit this parameter, the internal config hash, which has already been parsed,
will be used.

Example:

 my $content = $conf_obj->save_string(\%config);

or:

 my $content = $conf_obj->save_string();


=back


=head1 CONFIG FILE FORMAT

Lines begining with B<#> and empty lines will be ignored. (see section COMMENTS!)
Spaces at the begining and the end of a line will also be ignored as well as tabulators.
If you need spaces at the end or the beginning of a value you can use
apostrophs B<">.
An optionline starts with it's name followed by a value. An equalsign is optional.
Some possible examples:

 user    max
 user  = max
 user            max

If there are more than one statements with the same name, it will create an array
instead of a scalar. See the example below.

The method B<getall> returns a hash of all values.


=head1 BLOCKS

You can define a B<block> of options. A B<block> looks much like a block
in the wellknown apache config format. It starts with E<lt>B<blockname>E<gt> and ends
with E<lt>/B<blockname>E<gt>. An example:

 <database>
    host   = muli
    user   = moare
    dbname = modb
    dbpass = D4r_9Iu
 </database>

Blocks can also be nested. Here is a more complicated example:

 user   = hans
 server = mc200
 db     = maxis
 passwd = D3rf$
 <jonas>
        user    = tom
        db      = unknown
        host    = mila
        <tablestructure>
                index   int(100000)
                name    char(100)
                prename char(100)
                city    char(100)
                status  int(10)
                allowed moses
                allowed ingram
                allowed joice
        </tablestructure>
 </jonas>

The hash which the method B<getall> returns look like that:

 print Data::Dumper(\%hash);
 $VAR1 = {
          'passwd' => 'D3rf$',
          'jonas'  => {
                       'tablestructure' => {
                                             'prename' => 'char(100)',
                                             'index'   => 'int(100000)',
                                             'city'    => 'char(100)',
                                             'name'    => 'char(100)',
                                             'status'  => 'int(10)',
                                             'allowed' => [
                                                            'moses',
                                                            'ingram',
                                                            'joice',
                                                          ]
                                           },
                       'host'           => 'mila',
                       'db'             => 'unknown',
                       'user'           => 'tom'
                     },
          'db'     => 'maxis',
          'server' => 'mc200',
          'user'   => 'hans'
        };

If you have turned on B<-LowerCaseNames> (see new()) then blocks as in the
following example:

 <Dir>
   <AttriBUTES>
     Owner  root
   </attributes>
 </dir>

would produce the following hash structure:

 $VAR1 = {
          'dir' => {
                    'attributes' => {
                                     'owner  => "root",
                                    }
                   }
         };

As you can see, the keys inside the config hash are normalized.

Please note, that the above config block would result in a
valid hash structure, even if B<-LowerCaseNames> is not set!
This is because I<Config::General> does not
use the blocknames to check if a block ends, instead it uses an internal
state counter, which indicates a block end.

If the module cannot find an end-block statement, then this block will be ignored.



=head1 NAMED BLOCKS

If you need multiple blocks of the same name, then you have to name every block.
This works much like apache config. If the module finds a named block, it will
create a hashref with the left part of the named block as the key containing
one or more hashrefs with the right part of the block as key containing everything
inside the block(which may again be nested!). As examples says more than words:

 # given the following sample
 <Directory /usr/frisco>
        Limit Deny
        Options ExecCgi Index
 </Directory>
 <Directory /usr/frik>
        Limit DenyAll
        Options None
 </Directory>

 # you will get:
 $VAR1 = {
          'Directory' => {
                           '/usr/frik' => {
                                            'Options' => 'None',
                                            'Limit' => 'DenyAll'
                                          },
                           '/usr/frisco' => {
                                              'Options' => 'ExecCgi Index',
                                              'Limit' => 'Deny'
                                            }
                         }
        };

You cannot have more than one named block with the same name because it will
be stored in a hashref and therefore be overwritten if a block occurs once more.



=head1 IDENTICAL OPTIONS

You may have more than one line of the same option with different values.

Example:
 log  log1
 log  log2
 log  log2

You will get a scalar if the option occured only once or an array if it occured
more than once. If you expect multiple identical options, then you may need to 
check if an option occured more than once:

 $allowed = $hash{jonas}->{tablestructure}->{allowed};
 if(ref($allowed) eq "ARRAY") {
     @ALLOWED = @{$allowed};
 else {
     @ALLOWED = ($allowed);
 }

The same applies to blocks and named blocks too (they are described in more detail
below). For example, if you have the following config:

 <dir blah>
   user max
 </dir>
 <dir blah>
   user hannes
 </dir>

then you would end up with a data structure like this:

 $VAR1 = {
          'dir' => {
                    'blah' => [
                                {
                                  'user' => 'max'
                                },
                                {
                                  'user' => 'hannes'
                                }
                              ]
                    }
          };

As you can see, the two identical blocks are stored in a hash which contains
an array(-reference) of hashes.

Under some rare conditions you might not want this behavior with blocks (and
named blocks too). If you want to get one single hash with the contents of
both identical blocks, then you need to turn the B<new()> parameter B<-MergeDuplicateBlocks>
on (see above). The parsed structure of the example above would then look like
this:

 $VAR1 = {
          'dir' => {
                    'blah' => [
                                  'user' => 'max',
                                  'user' => 'hannes'
                              ]
                    }
          };

As you can see, there is only one hash "dir->{blah}" containing multiple
"user" entries. As you can also see, turning on  B<-MergeDuplicateBlocks>
does not affect scalar options (i.e. "option = value").

If you don't want to allow more than one identical options, you may turn it off
by setting the flag I<AllowMutliOptions> in the B<new()> method to "no".
If turned off, Config::General will complain about multiple occuring options
whit identical names!



=head1 LONG LINES

If you have a config value, which is too long and would take more than one line,
you can break it into multiple lines by using the backslash character at the end
of the line. The Config::General module will concatenate those lines to one single-value.

Example:

command = cat /var/log/secure/tripwire | \
           mail C<-s> "report from tripwire" \
           honey@myotherhost.nl

command will become:
 "cat /var/log/secure/tripwire | mail C<-s> 'report from twire' honey@myotherhost.nl"


=head1 HERE DOCUMENTS

You can also define a config value as a so called "here-document". You must tell
the module an identifier which identicates the end of a here document. An
identifier must follow a "<<".

Example:

 message <<EOF
   we want to
   remove the
   homedir of
   root.
 EOF

Everything between the two "EOF" strings will be in the option I<message>.

There is a special feature which allows you to use indentation with here documents.
You can have any amount of whitespaces or tabulators in front of the end
identifier. If the module finds spaces or tabs then it will remove exactly those
amount of spaces from every line inside the here-document.

Example:

 message <<EOF
         we want to
         remove the
         homedir of
         root.
      EOF

After parsing, message will become:

   we want to
   remove the
   homedir of
   root.

because there were the string "     " in front of EOF, which were cutted from every
line inside the here-document.



=head1 INCLUDES

You can include an external file at any posision in your config file using the following statement
in your config file:

 <<include externalconfig.rc>>

If you turned on B<-UseApacheInclude> (see B<new()>), then you can also use the following
statement to include an external file:

 include externalconfig.rc

This file will be inserted at the position where it was found as if the contents of this file
were directly at this position.

You can also recurively include files, so an included file may include another one and so on.
Beware that you do not recursively load the same file, you will end with an errormessage like
"too many open files in system!".

By default included files with a relative pathname will be opened from within the current
working directory. Under some circumstances it maybe possible to
open included files from the directory, where the configfile resides. You need to turn on
the option B<-IncludeRelative> (see B<new()>) if you want that. An example:

 my $conf = Config::General(
                             -file => "/etc/crypt.d/server.cfg"
                             -IncludeRelative => 1
                           );

 /etc/crypt.d/server.cfg:
  <<include acl.cfg>>

In this example Config::General will try to include I<acl.cfg> from I</etc/crypt.d>:

 /etc/crypt.d/acl.cfg

The default behavior (if B<-IncludeRelative> is B<not> set!) will be to open just I<acl.cfg>,
whereever it is, i.e. if you did a chdir("/usr/local/etc"), then Config::General will include:

 /usr/local/etc/acl.cfg

Include statements can be case insensitive (added in version 1.25).

Include statements will be ignored within C-Comments and here-documents.



=head1 COMMENTS

A comment starts with the number sign B<#>, there can be any number of spaces and/or
tabstops in front of the #.

A comment can also occur after a config statement. Example:

 username = max  # this is the comment

If you want to comment out a large block you can use C-style comments. A B</*> signals
the begin of a comment block and the B<*/> signals the end of the comment block.
Example:

 user  = max # valid option
 db    = tothemax
 /*
 user  = andors
 db    = toand
 */

In this example the second options of user and db will be ignored. Please beware of the fact,
if the Module finds a B</*> string which is the start of a comment block, but no matching
end block, it will ignore the whole rest of the config file!

B<NOTE:> If you require the B<#> character (number sign) to remain in the option value, then
you can use a backlsash in front of it, to escape it. Example:

 bgcolor = \#ffffcc

In this example the value of $config{bgcolor} will be "#ffffcc", Config::General will not treat
the number sign as the begin of a comment because of the leading backslash.

=head1 OBJECT ORIENTED INTERFACE

There is a way to access a parsed config the OO-way.
Use the module B<Config::General::Extended>, which is
supplied with the Config::General distribution.

=head1 VARIABLE INTERPOLATION

You can use variables inside your configfiles if you like. To do
that you have to use the module B<Config::General::Interpolated>,
which is supplied with the Config::General distribution.


=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

Config::General exports some functions too, which makes it somewhat
easier to use it, if you like this.

=over

=item B<ParseConfig()>

This function takes exactly all those parameters, which are
allowed to the B<new()> method of the standard interface.

Example:

 use Config::General;
 my %config = ParseConfig(-file => "rcfile", -AutoTrue => 1);


=item B<SaveConfig()>

This function requires two arguments, a filename and a reference
to a hash structure.

Example:

 use Config::General;
 ..
 SaveConfig("rcfile", \%some_hash);


=item B<SaveConfigString()>

This function requires a reference to a config hash as parameter.
It generates a configuration based on this hash as the object-interface
method B<save_string()> does.

Example:

 use Config::General;
 my %config = ParseConfig(-file => "rcfile");
 .. # change %config something
 my $content = SaveConfigString(\%config);
